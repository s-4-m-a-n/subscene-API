```
For successful installation, the expected output is :
```
  $  subscene-API 0.1

``` 
## <ins>Usage<ins>:
  subscene API can be use both from command line and as a python package.
  Command line is not recommended here because it is just for testing purpose and all the features of the package are not included in CLI version. This API can be useful for developing subtitle downloader and any other web based project which includes subtitle information.
  
### :computer: Command Line Usage:
All the commands for subscene API can be found using ***help*** flag.
```
  $  subsceneAPI -h
    OR
  $  subsceneAPI --help
```
To get the list of available subtitles along with download links, try :
```
  $  subsceneAPI -t "movie title/name" -y "2020" -lng "english"
    OR
  $  subsceneAPI --title "movie title/name" --year "2020" --language "english"
```

***Remember,<br/>
  -t or --title and -y or --year is mandatory. The default argument for  -lng or --language is "english".You can find the possible choices for language in --help result*** <br/><br/>
  
### :page_with_curl: Library Usage: (recommended):heavy_check_mark:
    Import module subtitle from the package subsceneAPI
    
  ```python
    import subsceneAPI
    from subsceneAPI import subtitle
  ```
  Now,<br/>
      create an instance of subscene object by using function : 
      
  ```python  
      search(title="<movie name>",year="<yrs>,language="<language>",limit="<no of subtitles that you want>")
  ```
  :heavy_exclamation_mark:Note, the title is mandatory but not the limit and year.Although,year argument should be pass for more accurate and expected result.In addition, the default value for limit is 1 and all other possible values are positive integers and 'all'. With the value 'all', every available subtitles' information will be fetched.
  
   For instance , 
  ```python
    import subsceneAPI
    # or more ofthen,
    from subsceneAPI import subtitle    
    obj = subtitle.search(title="extraction",year="2020",language="english",limit="1")
 ```
 ### A simple implementation  :
 ```python
 >>>   from subsceneAPI import subtitle
 >>>   sub = subtitle.search(title="extraction",year="2020",language="english",limit="2")
 >>>   print(sub.ZIPlinks) # or obj.showZIPlinks()
